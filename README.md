# primavera-cmor-tables

A fork of https://github.com/PCMDI/cmip6-cmor-tables for the PRIMAVERA project.

A copy of the PRIMAVERA data request in Microsoft Excel format is included in
this repository.

To generate the PRIMAVERA tables:

```
$ python2.7 bin/make_primavera.py
```

`make_primavera.py` requires the openpyxl Python library and was tested with
openpyxl version 2.4.1. This can easily be installed into a virtualenv with:

```
$ pip install openpyxl==2.4.1
```
